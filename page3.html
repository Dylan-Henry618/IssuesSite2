      <p>So this is a map that has a rough approximation of where most of the incidents have occurred in Singapore. Being the second largest trade port in the world, it shouldn't be surprising that there have been so many cases, which unfortunately is getting worse by the day.</p>

      <p>As seen in the above graph, we are experiencing a pretty major outubreak that really has to be contained. The border still remains open for now but I suspect the situation will detoriorate and if the color becomes red, the entire area will be quarantined.
